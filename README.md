👋🏼 Hi, I'm SEA Eyo – a professional content writer and an aspiring data analyst. I have a passion for creating engaging and informative content for various audiences and platforms. I recently picked up a keen interest in Data Analysis and have began my journey into developing problem-solving skills, exploring data, and finding insights that can help businesses and organizations make better decisions.

👩🏽‍💻 I'm currently learning the use of tools like Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python and I'm eager to enhance my data skills. Here, I will be sharing some of the personal projects I will be working on and showcasing my creativity and analytical thinking.

🤝🏼 I'm looking to collaborate with other data enthusiasts and professionals who share my passion and vision. And also looking forward to volunteering, internship, and entry-level positions to enable me be a part of live projects.

📫 You can reach me at sea.eyooku@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharon-eunice-amanda-eyo-oku-b99957183

😄 Fun fact: I love reading books, watching movies, listening to music, and traveling to new places.
